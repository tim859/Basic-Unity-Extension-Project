# Basic Unity Extension Project

A project made 7 months ago for my Games Technology module in the second year of my Computer Science (Games) course. I've kinda forgotten how it works tbh but I spent a lot of time on it and i know that the tools were working pretty well when i handed them in.

This project is made up of three tools:

1. An NPC path tool that allows you to map out the paths of NPC's without having to do tons of manual coding.

b. A measurement tool that allows you to measure distances in units between points in unity on each of the different axis.

4. A paint brush tool that allows you to paint prefabs (like trees or bushes or something) onto the environment.

I don't know why anyone would want to but you're very welcome to use this code however you want, just so long as you put a link to this repo in a comment somewhere :)
